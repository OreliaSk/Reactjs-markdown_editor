# Markdown editor app (using Reactjs)


### This app will allow you to make a layout using markdown syntax. Test it !
### For using the app, make sure you have npm, yarn and node.js installed.


### Use those commands to generate node-modules &co (using create-react-app).
```
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app markdown-editor
```
### Then,
```
cd markdown-editor
yarn start
```

## What I used to build this app :
* Reactjs
* Webpack (via create react app)
* Marked (plugins) https://github.com/chjj/marked
* HTML
* CSS
